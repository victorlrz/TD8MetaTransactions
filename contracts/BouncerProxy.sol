  Bouncer identity proxy that executes meta transactions for etherless accounts.
  Purpose:
  I wanted a way for etherless accounts to transact with the blockchain through an identity proxy without paying gas.
  I'm sure there are many examples of something like this already deployed that work a lot better, this is just me learning.
    (I would love feedback: https://twitter.com/austingriffith)
  1) An etherless account crafts a meta transaction and signs it
  2) A (properly incentivized) relay account submits the transaction to the BouncerProxy and pays the gas
  3) If the meta transaction is valid AND the etherless account is a valid 'Bouncer', the transaction is executed
      (and the sender is paid in arbitrary tokens from the signer)
